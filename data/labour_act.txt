the employer for the preceding 12 (twelve) months; 
(b) where the worker was in the service of the employer who is liable to 
pay the compensation for a continuous period of less than 1(one)

accident, was being earned by a worker employed on the same work 
by the same employer, or, if there was no worker so employed, by any 
other worker employed on similar work in the same locality; 
(c) in other cases, the monthly wages shall be the sum arrived at on the 
basis of the following calculation:  
30 (thirty) times of the total wages earned from the employer who is 
liable to pay compensation for a continuous period of service 
immediately preceding the accident divided by the number of days 
comprising such period. 
Explanation.For the purposes of this section, any period of service shall be 
deemed to be continuous which is not interrupted by a period of absence from work 
for exceeding 14 (fourteen) days. 
153. Review.

(1) Any monthly compensation payable under this Chapter, 
whether under an agreement between the parties or under an order of the Labour 
Court, may be reviewed by the Labour Court, if 
(a) an application is made either by the employer or by the worker 
accompanied by a certificate of a registered medical practitioner 
stating that the condition of the worker has been changed; or 
(b) besides such certificate, an application is made either by the employer 
or by the worker on the ground that the compensation was fixed by 
fraud or undue influence or other improper means or from the record 
it is clearly seen that such fixation was wrong. 
(2) Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, any monthly compensation may, 
on review under this section, be continued, increased, decreased or stopped, or if it 
is found that permanent disablement results from the accident, the monthly 
compensation payable may be converted to the lump sum to which the worker is 
entitled, but the sum already received as monthly compensation shall be deducted 
from it.

154. Payment of monthly compensation by lump-sum.

(1) The employer 
may pay  monthly compensation payable to a worker by paying a lump-sum amount 
on the basis of the agreement between the parties. 
(2) If there is no such agreement and the payment of compensation continues

application of either party, by the payment of such lump sum amount as may be 
determined by the Labour Court. 
155. Distribution of compensation.

(1) No compensation payable in 
respect of a  worker died from injury and no lump sum amount payable as 
compensation to a person under a legal disability, shall be paid otherwise than by 
making deposit with the Labour Court. 
(2) If any compensation mentioned in sub-section (1) is paid directly by an 
employer, it shall not be deemed to be a payment of compensation, unless the 
concerned worker, during the period of his employment, has nominated in the 
manner prescribed by rules any of his heirs to receive the compensation in the 
event of an injury resulting in his death and the compensation is paid to that 
nominated heir. 
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in the case of a 
deceased worker, the employer may make advance payment as compensation to any 
of his dependents, and the Labour Court shall, deducting such advance from the 
compensation payable to such dependent, refund it to the employer 1[:] 
2[Provided that where, in the case of a deceased worker, any amount is paid 
for his burial or treatment or carrying of dead body, it shall not be deducted from 
any amount paid in advance by the employer or from the compensation payable to 
the dependents through the Labour Court.] 
(4) Any other sum payable as compensation may be deposited with the Labour 
Court on behalf of the person entitled thereto. 
(5) A receipt given by the Labour Court shall be a sufficient discharge in 
respect of any compensation deposited with it. 
(6) On the deposit of any money as compensation in respect of a deceased 
worker under sub-section (1), the Labour Court may, if necessary, by a notice 
published, or served on each dependent, in such manner as it thinks fit, call upon the 
dependents to appear before it on such date as it may fix for determining the 
distribution of the compensation. 
(7) If the Labour Court is satisfied after any enquiry, which it may deem 
necessary, that there exists no dependent, the Court shall, after not less than 2 (two) 
years following the date of deposit, transfer the undistributed money deposited with 
it for the welfare of workers to such fund which the Government may, by 
notification in the official Gazette, specify or establish.

statement showing in detail all disbursements made by it. 
(9) Any compensation deposited in respect of a deceased worker shall, subject 
to any deduction made under the provisions of sub-section (3), be apportioned 
among the dependents of the deceased worker or among any of them in such 
proportion as the Labour Court thinks fit, or the Labour Court may, in its discretion, 
allot it to any one dependent. 
(10) Where any compensation deposited with the Labour Court is payable to 
any person, the Labour Court shall, if the person to whom the compensation is 
payable is not under any legal disability, pay to him, and in other cases, may pay to 
the person entitled thereto. 
(11) Where any lump sum deposited with the Labour Court is payable to a 
person who is under a legal disability, such sum may be invested or applied for the 
benefit of such person during his disability in such manner as the Labour Court may 
direct. 
(12) Where a half monthly compensation is payable to any person who is 
under a legal disability, the Labour Court may, on its own or on an application, give 
order to pay such compensation during his disability to any dependent of the 
concerned worker or to any other person whom the Labour Court thinks fit to 
provide for the welfare of such worker. 
(13) Where on an application or otherwise the Labour Court is satisfied that 
due to negligence of a parent to heir her children, or due to changes of the 
circumstances of any dependent, or for any other sufficient reason, any order of the 
Labour Court as to the distribution of any sum paid as compensation or any order of 
such Court as to the investment or application of any compensation payable to any 
such dependent is to be varied, the Labour Court may make such order for the 
variation of its former order as it thinks fit in the circumstances of the case: 
Provided that if such order is prejudicial to any person, such order shall not be 
made, unless such person has been given an opportunity of showing cause against 
such order, or in any case in which it is necessary to make repayment by the 
dependent of any sum already paid to him as compensation. 
(14) Where the Labour Court varies any order under sub-section (13) on the 
ground that the payment of compensation to any person has been obtained by fraud, 
impersonation or any other improper means, any compensation so paid may be 
recovered from him under the provisions of section 329. 
156.  Prohibition to assign, attach or charge compensation.

Save as 
provided in this Chapter, any lump sum or monthly compensation payable under

preferred within 2 (two) years of the occurrence of the accident or in case of death 
within 2 (two) years of the date of death. 
(2) Where the accident is the contracting of a disease in respect of which the 
provisions of section 150 (3) is applicable, the accident shall be deemed to have 
occurred on the first day of the continuous absence of the worker in consequence of 
the disablement caused by the said disease. 
(3) Any defect or irregularity in or want of a notice shall not be a bar to the 
consideration of a claim 
(a) if the claim is preferred in respect of the death of a worker resulting 
from an accident which occurs 
(i) 
(ii) 
on the house or premises of the employer; or

employed had knowledge of the accident from any other source at or 
about the time when it was occurred. 
(4) The Labour Court may consider and decide any claim to compensation in 
any case notwithstanding that the notice is not given, or the claim is not preferred, 
in due time, as provided in the aforesaid sub-section, if it is satisfied that there was 
sufficient reason for the failure to give such notice or prefer such claim. 
(5) In every such notice the name and address of the person injured shall be 
mentioned and the cause of the injury and the date of the accident shall be stated in 
easy language, and shall be served on the employer or upon any person responsible 
to the employer for the management of the trade or business in which the injured 
worker was employed. 
(6) A notice under this section shall be served by delivering it at, or sending it


(1) 
Where a Labour Court receives information from any source that a worker has died 
as a result of an accident arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, it shall 
send, by registered post, a notice to the worker’s employer requiring him to submit, 
within 30 (thirty) days of the service of the notice, a statement, in the form 
prescribed by rules, giving the reasons and circumstances attending the death of the 
worker, and indicating whether, in the opinion of the employer, he is or is not liable 
to deposit compensation on account of the death,

compensation, he shall, in his statement, state the grounds of it. 
(4) Where the employer disclaims his liability as mentioned above, the Labour 
Court may, after such enquiry as it may think fit, inform any of the dependents of the 
deceased worker that it is open to the dependents to prefer a claim for 
compensation, and may provide them such other information, as the Court thinks fit. 
159.  Report of fatal accident.

Where, by any law for the time being in force, 
any notice is required to be given to any authority, as to the death resulting from an

(1) Where a worker gives notice of an accident, 
the employer shall, within 3 (three) days of service of such notice, cause the worker 
to be examined 1[at the expense of the employer] by a registered medical practitioner 
and the worker shall submit himself for such examination: 
Provided that if the accident or illness of the worker is of grave nature, the 
employer shall cause him to be examined at the place where the worker is staying. 
(2) If any worker continues to receive monthly compensation under this 
Chapter,  he shall, if so required, submit himself for such examination from time to 
time. 
(3) Where a worker is not examined as aforesaid, he may get himself examined 
by a registered medical practitioner and the employer shall be liable to pay him the 
expenses for such examination. 
(4) No worker shall be ordered to present himself for medical examination 
under sub-section (1) or (2) otherwise than in accordance with rules made under 
this Chapter or on any day other than the day prescribed by rules. 
(5) If a worker being ordered by the employer under sub-section (1) or (2) or 
by the Labour Court at any time, refuses to present himself to the registered medical 
practitioner for medical examination or in any other way obstructs the same, his 
right to compensation shall remain suspended during the continuance of such 
refusal or obstruction, unless, in the case of refusal, he was prevented by sufficient 
cause from so presenting himself. 
1The words “at the expense of the employer” were substituted for the words “free of cost” by section 45(a) of the Bangladesh Labour 
(Amendment) Act, 2013 (Act No. XXX of 2013).

(6) If a worker, before the expiry of the period within which he is supposed to 
present himself for medical examination under sub-section (1) or (2), voluntarily 
leaves, without having been so examined, the vicinity of his place of employment, his 
right to compensation shall remain suspended until he returns or offers himself for 
such examination. 
(7) If a worker, whose right to compensation is suspended under sub-sections 
(5) and (6) dies without having present himself for medical examination as required 
under any of the foregoing sub-sections, the Labour Court may, if it thinks fit, direct 
for the payment of compensation to the dependents of the deceased worker. 
(8) Where under sub-section (5) or (6) the right to any compensation is 
suspended, no compensation shall be payable in respect of the period of suspension 
and if the period of suspension commences before the expiry of the waiting period

duration of suspension. 
(9) Where an injured worker, being offered by the employer of medical 
treatment by a medical practitioner free of charge, refuses to accept it, or having 
accepted such offer deliberately disregards the instructions of such medical 
practitioner, and if it is proved that the worker has not thereafter been regularly 
attended by a registered medical practitioner or having been so attended has 
deliberately failed to follow medical practitioner's instructions and such refusal, 
disregard or failure was unreasonable in the circumstances of the case and the 
injury is aggravated thereby, the injury and the disablement evident from it shall be 
deemed to be of the same nature and duration as they might have reasonably been 
expected to be if the worker had been regularly attended by a registered medical 
practitioner and had followed his instructions, and the compensation, if any, shall be 
payable accordingly. 
(10) Where any employer or the injured worker is not satisfied with the report 
of the medical examination by a registered medical practitioner, he may refer the 
case for re-examination by a medical specialist of at least the rank of an Associate 
Professor of a Medical College, and the expenses incurred for such examination shall 
be borne by the employer or the worker, as the case may be.

execution of the whole or any part of any work which is ordinarily the part of his 
trade or business, the said employer shall be liable to pay to any worker employed 
by the contractor for the execution of the work any compensation which he would 
have been liable to pay if the worker had been directly employed by him and where 
compensation is claimed from the employer the wages received from the contractor 
shall be taken into cognizance for fixing the compensation. 
2[(2) Where sub-section (1) applies, all compensation shall be paid by the 
principal or original employer. 
(3) Where the principal or original employer is of the opinion that the 
occurrence of death or injury of the concerned worker has been specially and in fact 
occurred as a result of violation of any rules of conduct on behalf of the contractor, 
he may, after depositing the full amount of compensation in the Labour Court (in the 
case of the death of the worker) or after payment of the prescribed amount of 
money to the worker concerned (in the case of the injury of the  worker), apply to 
the Chief Inspector to determine the share of the said amount which should be paid 
by the contractor to the principal or original employer, and the Chief Inspector shall, 
within 45 (forty five) days of receipt of the application, dispose of it according to 
rules.]

contract with any insurer in respect of any liability of the workers under this 
Chapter, in the event of the employer becoming insolvent or making a scheme of 
arrangement with his creditors, or if the employer is a company and it commences 
to be wound up,  the right of the employer against the insurer in respect of such 
liability shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time 
being in force relating to insolvency or the winding up of a company, be transferred 
to and vest in the worker, and upon any such transfer the insurer shall have the 
same rights and remedies and be subject to the same liabilities, as if he were the 
employer, provided that the insurer shall not be under any greater liability to the 
workers than the employer would have been to the workers. 
(2) If the liability of the insurer to the worker is less than that of the employer, 
the worker may prove it in the insolvency or liquidation proceedings.

the part of the employer with any terms and conditions of the contract, other than 
the payment of the premium, the provisions of the said sub-section shall apply as if 
the contract were not void or voidable, and the insurer shall be entitled to prove in 
the insolvency or liquidation proceedings the amount paid to the worker: 
Provided that the provisions of this sub-section shall not apply in a case where 
the worker fails to give notice to the insurer of the accident and of any resultant 
disablement after as soon as practicable, the initiation of the insolvency or 
liquidation proceedings became known to him. 
(4) Any compensation, the liability for payment of which arose before the date 
of the order of adjudication of an insolvent or, as the case may be, before the date of 
the commencement of the winding up proceedings of a company, shall be deemed to 
have been included among the debts which are repayable in priority over all other 
debts under section 49 of the Insolvency (Dacca) Act, 1909 (Act No. III of 1909), or 
under section 61 of the Insolvency Act, 1920 ( Act No. V of 1920) and under section

the property of the insolvent or in the case of distribution of the assets of the 
company being wound up and the said Acts shall have effect accordingly. 
(5) Where the compensation is a monthly payment, the amount due in respect 
thereof shall, for the purposes of this section, be taken to be the amount of the lump 
sum for which the monthly payment could, if redeemable, be redeemed if 
application were made for that purpose under section 154, and a certificate of the 
Labour Court as to the amount of such lump sum shall be conclusive proof thereof. 
(6) The provisions of sub-section (4) shall apply in the case of any amount for 
which an insurer is entitled to prove under sub-section (3), but such provision shall 
otherwise not apply where the insolvent or the company being wound up has

of a lump sum, whether by way of redemption of a monthly payment 
or otherwise, or an agreement as to the amount of compensation 
payable to a person under a legal disability, should not be registered 
by reason of the inadequacy of the sum or amount or by reason of 
having been obtained by fraud or undue influence or other improper 
means; the Court may make such order as to any sum already paid 
under the agreement, as it thinks just in the circumstances. 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, an agreement for 
the payment of compensation registered under sub-section (1) shall be enforceable
